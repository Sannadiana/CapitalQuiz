# CapitalQuiz
I'm learning basic programming in Java, and have here made a GUI in JavaFx, plus I have tried some Exception handling.

Run the main method and you'll be queried what capital correspond to the given country and its flag.
You can type your answer in the text field and click the button, or just press enter to go to the next question. Enjoy ! :)
